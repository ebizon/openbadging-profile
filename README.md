<b><u>What is Open Badging system?</u></b><br><br>

The Open Badges (Open Badge Infrastructure or OBI) is basically a project initiated by Mozilla with a vision of encouraging lifelong learning process.

It is an open technical standard developed by Mozilla.

It extends the concept of digital badges by allowing for verification of the <ul>
  <li>skills</li>
<li>interests and achievements represented by badges</li>
<li>identity of the badge earner</li></ul>

Open Badges are designed to be portable between systems.

The basic intention of OBI is to help people of all ages gain and display 21st century skills and unlock new career and educational opportunities.

It is trying to make it easier for anyone to issue, earn and display badges across the web, through a shared technical infrastructure.
